Education is the hope of development and success for most third-world countries and the world’s dominion countries. Mandatory education builds the scope of better growth and development.

Role of Education in India

Education has the potential to revolutionize the course of a nation – with skilled and educated youths. A nation comprises a higher rate to achieve its targeted economic growth and sit among the league known as the developed nation. A well-educated nation discards any obstacles that hinder its growth and strives hard to attain sustainable development.

Factors contributing to the Importance of Education in India

Eradicate the fickle of Unemployment

The substantial effect of illiteracy is ‘unemployment.’ Unemployment hinders the progress of a nation-leading to low standards of living and an increased crime rate.

India is stuck in a critical situation where almost 58 percent of unemployed graduates and 77 percent of the families are void of regular income. About 67 percent receive an annual income of less than 1.2 Lakh per anum.


 
In this circumstance, India cannot risk leaving any child illiterate, as it would push him towards a life of Unemployment and misery.

Removes Poverty

As India is one of the fastest-growing economies in 2020, poverty is on the decline in the country and is one of the greatest evils of illiteracy. Till the year 2012, India earned the appellation of homing the most significant number of poor in the world.

In India, nearly 70.6 Million people still live in abject poverty, and the way to discard the vicious cycle of poverty is through Education. Higher rates of literacy result in high access to employability, which in turn provides better living conditions.

Eradicates Casteism

The caste system is the world’s longest surviving social hierarchy in India. Caste-based discrimination cripples the path of sustainable development in India. A society that discriminates based on caste, creed, race, religion, or color remains entangled in the web of hatred, poverty, and inadequate resources.

The contributing factor to the prevalent orthodox customs is illiteracy. Education changes an individual’s perspective on caste discrimination. It makes an individual caste neutral with a progressive mindset that wills to contribute productively to the nation.

Economic Stability and Growth

Education is an integral tool that helps a nation to achieve economic growth and stability. India homes twenty million youths that graduate annually from various disciplines and set out to aid in the economic development of the nation.

Educating youth and adults reveals the hidden potential, which could lead India to the path of development.

Improvisation in Health and Hygiene

Countries with a high rate of illiteracy are bound with poor hygienic conditions and health. India has walked past the decades where it lost millions of lives to diseases that resulted from the absence of healthcare facilities and poor sanitation.

To improvise the health and hygiene sector of the country, schemes such as ‘Swachh Bharat Mission,’ Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram’ etc., draws people to come safely under the fold. A literate person gains knowledge about health and hygiene issues and the schemes of the government and benefits from them.
