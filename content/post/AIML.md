No one can escape the absolute necessity of technology in our daily lives. Each of us is so heavily dependent on technology that we cannot do anything easily without it. 
Technology is important because it is used in all areas of life. When you contemplate your daily routine and count all the technology gadgets you consume in just one day, you will realize how important technology is when you use mobile, watch TV, drive a car, and use a computer or any electrical machine. 
In fact, day after day is increasing depending on technology whether during communication or transportation or search for any information or even entertainment. 
Humans have also reached the moon with the revolution in space technology. Technology can not only help with the present but also bring the future closer. Hence, technology is undeniably important in our lives

*Technology*

Technology is defined as a comprehensive process based on the application of science and knowledge in many areas of life in an orderly and thoughtful manner in order to achieve the important and valuable purposes for individuals and communities.

How Has Technology Changed Our Lives?

The advent of modern technology brought about great changes in our modern life. Before the technology, the man did not know many modern means in his life but relied on simple primitive tools in everything. 
Evidence of history tells us how Neanderthals used stones to burn fire to cook food and so on. Wood was used to make spears, which were used to hunt animals and other primitive methods. 
Then, over the years, these techniques developed gradually until we reached the peak of technological advances in the present day. 
Where technology knocked on the doors of people and broke into their homes without permission. So what are the most significant changes that technology has brought to our modern lives?

How Important Technology is in Our Daily Lives?

There is no doubt that we are experiencing a tremendous development in technology. This technology has had a negative or positive impact on our life. As a result, it has influenced the way we live and we rely heavily on it. Humans continue to evolve continuously. 
Technology will not stop at a single threshold, but we still hear daily discoveries and inventions by scientists. Technology has spread all over the world and people use it all the time. 
It is no longer limited to work and in developed societies, but any person, regardless of his or her cultural or social level, or whatever his age, can use a cell phone, for example, to take pictures, send and receive them. 
Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use phones and computers to talk to them and even see them. 
Our daily work office is also technology-based. People no longer use pen and paper to complete their work. We keep our health by going to the gyms. 
There are machines in the gym that help us reduce our weight and keep fit. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the use of technology. 
Technology can not be appropriate in some tasks and negative influences. Everyone determines and decides how to use this technology in a negative or positive way. 
The same technology can be used by two people in a different way.

Importance of Technology in Communication

 Technological advances in communication have become endless. Technology is of great importance in terms of facilitating communication between people, as it has contributed effectively to make the big world look like a small village. 
This has been achieved with technology that provides opportunities for people to promote and facilitate communication between them, ranging from fixed and mobile phones to the Internet and the related ability of people to communicate with each other across continents and countries in a matter of seconds. 
Technology provides the possibility of communication between many parties in different regions of the world very quickly, which helps them to spread, both in the dissemination of information and various news or in the sharing of knowledge and science.

Modern Technology and the World Wide Web

The World Wide Web is defined as all content on the Internet such as web pages, videos, and images that are displayed in HTML and can be accessed through the user's web browser. 

It should be noted that the Web is symbolized by the abbreviation (WWW), and access to this network through a communication protocol known as (HTTP), and this network was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. 
After the invention of the Web, and when it became accessible to all people, its pages were filled with millions of sites that serve people in their lives by providing information and knowledge and allowing people to communicate with each other through programs that allow seeing the caller still and moving pictures.

Importance of Technology in Education

Technology contributes significantly to the access and acquisition of information, and thus the development. This is the reason for the existence of a huge scientific and cognitive revolution, which entails facilitating human life by increasing inventions in various practical fields.

E-learning is one of the most significant contributions of technology to learning; The learner can control his / her education system by managing the learning process, the content of the learning process, and communicating with colleagues in the learning process. 

E-learning has provided the learner with many programs that provide immediate reference to what the learner is asking for, by providing discussion forums and libraries that allow questions to be asked and answered very quickly. 
Technological advances have also allowed the so-called open education that allows people with health problems or living far away to enroll in online classrooms.

Importance of Technology In Decision-Making and Problem-Solving

Technology has contributed to solving various human problems, especially at the present time due to the rapid state of change associated with the amount of information that exists. 
It has also facilitated communication between human beings and has helped to provide different means of transport and introduced new agricultural methods that are a reason for increasing food production. 

It should be noted that applications made in the field of health care and consequently positive, and many other technological means have developed the lives of people, and helped them save time and effort.  
For example, technology supplies factories with many advanced machines and equipment that have helped to provide high-quality goods and services, facilitate production processes in factories and make them less time and effort-consuming, in addition to reducing the cost of operating for the benefit of employers.

Importance of Technology in Domestic Work

The electric power provides light people homes and roads; it is used to power electrical tools, factories, etc. 
There are many modern tools that made it easier for people, such as a vacuum cleaner, which was replaced by old tools used to do so, as well as the electric heating device for various foods called (microwave), and the ordinary oven. 
The electric has made it easier for the housewife to prepare food easily and quickly and many other modern tools that are truly a blessing from God to modern man.

Importance of Technology in Health Care

Technology has helped doctors answer all patient queries faster. There are various technological innovations in the health sector, such as the invention of certain drugs, the development of information technology, biotechnology, development processes. 
Technology constantly strives to contribute to the development of instruments and equipment used in the medical field and to preserve the healthy lives of people and raise their standard of care. 
This has led to the development of some inventions to become larger and more useful and complex in the installation, such as detectors and magnetic resonance imaging, and industrial devices with an automated system.
